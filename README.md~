> A dark, colorful, neat theme, resembling the sparkling colors of an opal, contrasted against an indigo-night editor background, with purple, cyan, and pink ui accents.

## Features

1. Active and hovered tabs are underlined thickly with cyan.
2. Larger-than normal pink circles form instead of the close icon on modified tabs, and the large cyan close icon flashes after saving the modified file.
3. Gray-violet base accent colors, used for the scrollbars, button border colors, and tooltips.
4. Scrollbars flash pink when selected and dragged, mimicking an opal's facets.
5. Indigo-themed autocomplete dropdown list with a lighter indigo accent for even selections.
6. Very dark indigo editor background matches the dropdown and doesn't clash with the dark-gray panel colors.
7. Buttons flash indigo upon mouse hover, matching the indigo-patterned autocomplete dropdown and editor background.
8. Modified files are colored pink in the tree-view, and successfully-created files are colored soft-cyan.
